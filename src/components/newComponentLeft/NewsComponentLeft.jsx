      <span>
        <br />
        The Wild Boys Camp-out, established in 2020 by a bunch of blue collar,
        beer-drinking, eagle-riding motorcycle hooligans. We began by
        spontaneously putting together a casual last minute camp-outs that more
        than 100 people attended. When this began we never had the intentions to
        make it an annual event but because of how memorable the camp-out turned
        out. I decided to make this a summer event in hopes of bringing even
        more of the motorcycle community together. Our philosophy is to keep
        things simple and keep things old school - good laughs, good times and
        good people. No fancy shit! Just pitch a tent, grab a beer and enjoy
        your time with some cool, like-minded people. We are dedicated to
        supporting our community and bringing our community together through
        these events. Our culture of inclusiveness, loyalty respect, and the
        open road is something we cherish and invite you to be part of. We host
        one big camp-out every summer for two nights and I'm sure you won't want
        to miss this event. Currently Wild Boys July 2, 2021 is on the go!
        Location is set, the logistics are completed and the bands are booked,
        but due to the current government restrictions on outdoor gatherings,
        ticket sales have been put on hold. Stay up to date with out newsletter
        and on our social media platforms In addition to the main event each
        year. We host two shotgun camp-outs per year as well. These are
        spur-of-moment spontaneous events ( don't worry will make sure you know
        when ) one-night adventures. Where we meet up at a location and ride out
        to a spot to kick it for a night. Our goal is to keep The Wild Boy's
        Camp-outs true to the old-school vibe. With being focused mostly on
        riding and a real down-to-earth camp-out experience. No pretentiousness,
        nothing fancy grab your friends, and everyone is invited and included.
        Come on out and set up your spot and get to know people make new friends
        and have some laughs. Get away from the city and get some wind in your
        face and enjoy the thing we all love. The Wild Boys Camp Out welcomes
        anyone and everyone we just ask that you respect one another, the
        environment and your surroundings.
